# MadeByParm.com Frontend

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript app for the MadeByParm portfolio. It uses TailwindCSS for styling, Framer Motion for simple animations, and React Router DOM for routing.

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js 18+ and pnpm or npm.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The site will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

The app expects the Django backend to run at `/api/` on the same domain when in development.
